All I can say - is in the title
To learn is never late. I am 37 years old now. And I full of ideas about programming.</br>
The day when I stop to learn will be my last day as human person.</br>
Any kind of interest to my work from Your side will be appreciated.
Many years I am only read about programming, and I thought, that this will make me a great programmer.</br>
<strong>Now, I realized, that only practice can do this with me.</strong></br>
So, don't make my errors! Make full-stack of programming life: 
<ul>
  <li>Dream</li>
  <li>make plans</li>
  <li>code</li>
  <li>check errors</li>
  <li>show your work to the World!</li>
</ul>
